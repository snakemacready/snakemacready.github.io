## Remediated Version

## Introduction
I recently came across an interesting authentication bypass vulnerability in some vendor software that controls badge-accessed door locks in commercial buildings. The software is called Cobalt X1, created by the vendor Blue Access. The discovery of this vulnerability came as a result of a sanctioned penetration test I was performing. I was able to exploit the vulnerability, which resulted in full administrative access to the application, effectively controlling all doors and employee badge access to this specific building.

## Technical Details
When presented with a login page during a pentest, I typically begin as anyone would, with attempting to login using common credentials. Even when mostly unsuccessful, I can still observe the login behavior and potentially enumerate more information during this process. When observing the http response for the invalid login attempt, I noticed that it contained a bearer token in the body, which showed the "userName" property as "admin", the username I had entered. I then attempted to access the "redirect" url in the token: '/cobalt/main'. I was now on the main dashboard of the Cobalt X1 application, logged in as "admin". Looking at the token response from my initial invalid login, this is indeed a valid token for the admin user account. However, without force browsing to the dashboard url, this would simply go unnoticed.

## Attacker Value
When thinking about physical security, I think of security guards, RFID badges, and revolving doors. What I don't think about is all of that being bypassed by a poor authentication implementation in a vendor's badge access software. This exploit, while easily identified, poses pretty detrimental consequences in the wrong hands. (Think removing all employee badge access and completely locking down a hospital in exchange for a ransom...) I don't know the extent to which this software is widely used, but I know for the implementations I was testing, it could easily have similarly awful consequenses.

## Disclosure 
This vulnerability was disclosed to Blue Access, who immediately released a remediated patch in version 02.000.195.
